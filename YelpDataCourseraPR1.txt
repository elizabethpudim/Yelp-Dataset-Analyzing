Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (primary id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (by business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (by business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (by business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (primary id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (by business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (primary id)
viii. Tip = 537 (by user_id)
ix. User = 10000 (primary id)
x. Friend = 11 (by user_id)
xi. Elite_years =  2780 (by user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	NO
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

+-----------+------+--------+--------+

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	As we can see, Harald, Gerald, Christine, William and Fran are on the top by fans and also have top scores in "useful" or "funny" 
	cathegory (I also checked it sorted separately by each of this cathegories) So, it's 5/10 = 50% and medium relationship. 
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

1)
SELECT b.stars, h.hours, count(h.hours), c.category, b.name, b.city
FROM ((business b
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id)
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id)
WHERE b.City='Las Vegas' and c.category = 'Restaurants' and b.stars IN (2, 2.5, 3)
GROUP BY h.hours
+-------+----------------------+----------------+-------------+----------+-----------+
| stars | hours                | count(h.hours) | category    | name     | city      |
+-------+----------------------+----------------+-------------+----------+-----------+
|   3.0 | Friday|11:00-0:00    |              1 | Restaurants | Wingstop | Las Vegas |

|   4.0 | Wednesday|11:00-20:00 |              1 | Restaurants | Jacques Cafe        | Las Vegas |
+-------+-----------------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+-----------+
In group with 4-5 stars there are more variants of hours. So, some difference exists.
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
123 - sum of reviews with 2-3 stars and 936 with 4-5.
SELECT SUM(distinct b.review_count), city, stars, name, id
FROM ((business b
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id)
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id)
WHERE b.City='Las Vegas' and c.category = 'Restaurants' and b.stars IN (4, 4.5, 5)        
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Location data inconclusive as related to how a business is rated 
SQL code used for analysis:
Higher.
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Number of reviews. In still open businesses sum of reviews is 7 times higher than in closed. 
+-------------------+-------------------+
| SUM(review_count) | AVG(review_count) |
+-------------------+-------------------+
|            269300 |     31.7570754717 |
+-------------------+-------------------+ for open 

+-------------------+-------------------+
| SUM(review_count) | AVG(review_count) |
+-------------------+-------------------+
|             35261 |     23.1980263158 |
+-------------------+-------------------+ for closed
Also, we see difference in average. So, reviews are important for business.        
         
ii. Difference 2:
Let's analyze categories of business.Restaurants, Nightlife, Bars, Shopping are on the top 10 of both groups(open/closed). 
But there are Health & Medica (16 open, 1 closed), Home Services(15/1), Beauty & Spas(12/1), that are more prespective to stay open, than close.       
So, category is one more important differene (and, yes, I just want to analyze with INNER JOINS here :)  
+---------------------------+-------------+
| category                  | count(b.id) |
+---------------------------+-------------+

| Local Services   |          10 |
+------------------+-------------+      open 
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT c.category, count(b.id)

FROM business b INNER JOIN category c

ON c.business_id = b.id

WHERE b.is_open = 1

GROUP BY c.category

ORDER BY count(b.id) desc

LIMIT 10
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
It will be interesting to predict overall rating, based on key features. And find out what is helpful for business to make it top-rated.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
As I analyzed higher, there are important features as review count, category, city, name.                         
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+--------------------------------+-------------------+----------+-------+--------------+
| name                           | city              | category | stars | review_count |
